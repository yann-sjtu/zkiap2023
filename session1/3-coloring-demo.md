#### [Question](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/graph/svg.html)  
   + Answer of Exercise 1:  
     It would not be zero knowledge if I could pick arbitrary pairs of nodes to check. Because the colors of adjacent pairs of nodes are constraints. But the colors of nonadjacent pairs of nodes are knowledge.
        
   + Answer of Exercise 2:  
     The equation of confidence should be $1-(1-(\frac{1}{E}))^n$. There is no prior because the prover will mix up the colorings every round.
